# Memory Game Project v1.0

This is the third project of FEND Scholarship Program, provided by Udacity,
in collaboration with Google.

## Brief Info about the Game

This card-matching game tests the player's memory as they attempt to match two
cards in a deck of sixteen cards. If two clicked cards don't match, they flip back to their original closed positions, so the players should try their best to remember which specific card is placed where to eventually match them all!

## How to Play

- Access the game via [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/acun/Memory-Game/blob/master/index.html)
- Click on a card to flip it over and reveal its symbol
- Click on another card to see if it's a match with the first card
  - if not, the cards will return back to their original, closed state.
  - if they **_do_** match, then they'll stay open, you may proceed to clicking the remaining cards
- Repeat the clicking and matching process until all eight pairs match!  

## Included Features

- A move counter
- A timer
- A three-star rating system (_that rates how well you did based on your moves_)
- A resetting feature that (_restarts the game for a clean slate_)

## Important Things to Note

This game is the very basic, bare bones version of the project. As I find more
time in the near future, I _will_ make **major improvements** to it, and mainly
fiddle with its styling and ponder on how to improve performance through
function optimization. Thank you for bearing with me through version one!
